![IoT JumpWay Docs](images/main/Raspberry-Pi-Examples.png)

## Introduction

IoT JumpWay is an IoT PaaS that allows anyone to connect IoT devices such as Raspberry Pi, Intel® Galileo, Arduino, ESP8266 and even phones,PCs, Macs and laptops to the Internet of Things. The various IoT JumpWay libraries and samples allow you to connect devices and sensors to the IoT JumpWay and control/monitor sensors/actuators and data to and from the devices.

The Raspberry Pi examples provide example projects that you can use to get started with using the IoT JumpWay for your IoT projects.
